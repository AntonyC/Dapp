# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
```shell
1. pnpm i
2. npx hardhat node
3. npx hardhat deploy --tags DeployAntonyAuction --network localhost
4. npx hardhat deploy --tags UpgradeAntonyAuction --network localhost
```
